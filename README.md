<h1> Hyperware </h1>
Hyperware is a bookmarklet on steroids for school with stuff like gimkit (work in progress) and blooket cheats along with games and other utilities.
This project is intended to primarly bypass GoGuardian, if you have another blocker, this might not work so don't blame me.


## How to Use:
<br>Step 1. Go to <a href="https://github.com/EternallyHyper/Hyperware/blob/main/bookmarklet.js" target="_blank">bookmarklet.js</a>
<br>Step 2. Copy the code and set it as the url for a bookmark
<br>Step 3. Run the bookmark on and only on about:blank (although other websites work for some reason)
